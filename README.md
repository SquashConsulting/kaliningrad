# Kaliningrad

GUI Based Database Modeler Leveraging Power of ArangoDB Multi-Model Data Store.

Since our software heavily relies on Graph databases we, at first, decided to name it Königsberg as a reference to a famous graph theory problem called ["Travelling Salesman Problem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). However having an umlaut(ö) in the repository name caused some problems; thus, we chose _Kalinigrad_ which was the name that was chosen for Königsberg after the WW2.
